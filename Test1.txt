Well, first of all, I will start with episode 1, as everything is useless!!

Now, this is the day when Naruto, becomes Hokage and Naruto is present there, not Konohamuru in disguise!! Everyone including Sasuke are present and are eagerly waiting for Naruto’s arrival.

Gaara being a close friend, attends the ceremony. He is proud of Naruto as he isn’t a blabbering child anymore, and has grown to be the strongest shinobi!! Naruto achieved what he said and what seemed impossible.

Iruka is really proud of his almost son, Naruto and can’t help but get emotional. Sakura is having her best day as Sasuke is home and her best friend Naruto is about to become the Hokage!!

Now, comes the man of the hour, Uzumaki Naruto and the crowd goes wild!! Naruto gives the speech and all and is about to go to his office, when a blast occurs in the east gate.

From there comes a flying white human, an Otsutsuki. Otsutsuki Isshiki.

I know, I introduced him quit early in the series but that is the only way, not to buff Sasuke and Naruto. Read further, you will understand what I am saying!!

Seeing an Otsutsuki, alarms the whole village and then there is panic everywhere. But before any stampede starts, an orange figure jumps towards the Otsutsuki.

Isshiki dodges Naruto, only to be punched by Sasuke and the fight starts!!! Seeing an Otsutsuki and that too in the middle of Konhoa, it panics Sasuke and Naruto.

Both of them doesn’t waste a single minute to go full power and let loose. Gaara beings one of the smart and powerful shinobi, covers the whole village in his Sand to protect it and to take one of the tensions out of the Naruto and Sasuke.

Then our favourite duo, start thrashing Isshiki and in only a matter of time he understands that he is utterly useless and is going to die.

Then Isshiki eats some chakra pills and a weird portals open and chains pop out of it and binds Naruto and Sasuke.Now, it starts dragging Naruto and Sasuke inside it!!! A damn sealing Jutsu!!

Sasuke shouts that they cannot escape this and are going to get sealed. This is the moment when both of them knows what to do.

Naruto converts one of his truthseeker orbs into a rod and throws into portal. And BAM!!! Sasuke uses his Rinnegan and exchanges position of the rod and Isshiki.

Naruto and Sasuke both fall into the portal dragging Isshiki with them.The Portal closes. All three are sealed!!!

Kakashi, Shikamaru, Gaara, Konohamaru, Sakura and Hinata who were going to jump in to help them are shocked beyond anything!!! The two strongest shinobis are engulfed in a portal.

Nobody knew anything about that portal nor any jutsu that can change the dimensions to go to help them!!

Moreover, Konhoa has suffered some minor damage and some of the shinobis were injured. So Sakura rushes to help and an emergency meeting is called!!

Kakashi is forced to take the Hokage’s position again as Konohamaru refuses to take up the position. Konohamaru says he is too weak for that position and will train very hard to become stronger!! He says, “ If someone like Naruto nee-chan and Sasuke-san and can be sealed then I am far, too weak!!”

Now, many years pass and Boruto graduates from the Academy and joins Konohamaru’s squad. They do some missions and all.

Boruto being a class topper and having a 100% success rate in completing missions has a big head!!

Now, Momoshiki attacks in order to obtain the Jougan and kill its wielder. It was prophesied that a wielder of Jougan will kill the Otsutsuki Clan. To prevent that from happening Momoshiki comes to kill Boruto!!!

Momoshiki havocs the entire village to kill Boruto. Now, Boruto is cornered and is one step away from death. That’s when a trident like kunai hits Momoshiki’s shoulder. That kunai has a yellow covering on its handle and a seal is written on it!!!

And the next thing Momoshiki knows is that a big rasengan has been put into his face!! Boruto sees the back of a genius, a shinobi feared by villages and a shinobi who is fastest in the whole world!! He is wearing a white clock and on it is written ‘The Fourth Hokage’. Minato sees Boruto and gives a warm smile and says “Don’t worry, you are safe now!!”.

Now Momoshiki gets up and is about to attack when a murder of crows come and start attacking him!! The next moment he knows he is in a genjutsu, a really powerful one indeed.

He is in a weird place and a shinobi stands in front of him, who gives him a really hard time for next 3 days!!

When he gets up, he is captured and in front of him stands the 4th Hokage and Uchiha Itachi of the Leaf.

He sees Kinishiki to be manhandled by a very strong shinobi. A shinobi whose chakra is nearly equal to nine-tails, who is called the God Of Shinobi. Senju Hashirama.

Momoshiki knowing he screwed up somehow breaks his chains and tries to flee, only to be caught by Hashirama again.

This time, Kinshiki turns into a fruit and flows to Momoshiki. Momoshiki eats it and a ferocious battle takes place between Momoshiki and Hashirama, Itachi and Minato.

Momoshiki soon realises, he can’t win and flees. Later, it is told that Orochimaru, used Edo Tensei to save the village and to equalise the favor of Konhoa; of letting Mitsuki become a Konhoa’s shinobi.

Now, Boruto and Sarada requests Orochimaru to let Minato and Itachi stay. They want to be trained, by Minato and Itachi, respectively.

Orochimaru doesn’t know what to do, but when both, Itachi and Minato agrees, he does so.

Minato not being able to spend time with his son, decides to compensate that by spending time with Boruto, his grand-son.

Itachi, a lovely brother, always wanted to spend time with Sasuke, also compensates by training Sarada, his niece.

Now, the Team 7 trains very hard to become powerful shinobis. Mitsuki being trained by Orochimaru, only.

Boruto masters Rasengan, learns a lightning style attacks and basic shuriken and kunai throwing jutsu. Minato makes sure that Boruto has a excellent chakra control and moreover he teaches him chakra release.

Sarada under Itachi, masters fire style, and shuriken jutsu. She is also able to use genjutsu but it is very basic and has a long way to go. Sarada being an Uchiha, already has an excellent chakra control.

Mitsuki masters his sage mode. Learns a tons of jutsus and becomes quite powerful. Probably the strongest genin, in the present.

During this Momoshiki comes back, more stronger as he gathers a large amounts of chakra pills. He attacks the village again, to kill Boruto and also to take revenge for last time.

But, this time Team 7 steps up to fight him. Now, the fight begins. The genins of team 7 fight with great team work and excellent strategies. Mitsuki doesn’t enter his sage mode but has one heck of speed.

Boruto has average speed but his Rasengan, harassed Momoshiki. Sarada’s shuriken jutsu, taught to her by Itachi-sama himself, makes sure that Momoshiki can’t use his absorbed jutsus.

The fight goes on, and it seemed the genins might win, but Momoshiki gets furious and thrashes Team 7. Now Boruto is cornered and Sarada and Mitsuki are injured.

Mitsuki decides to go sage mode, but Konohamura saves the day, by hitting Momoshiki by a Rasen-Shuriken. That’s right, the students aren’t the only one who got stronger.

Now, Minato comes into the ground and out of shadows. Says he was watching the whole fight and is proud of all 3 of them to be able to fight and survive against a kage level shinobi.

He praises Konohamaru too, to be able to complete, his incomplete jutsu, Rasengan. But Momoshiki, gets up.

Now, Minato tells all 3 of them to rest and that he and Konohamaru will take care of Momoshiki.

There goes Konoha’s Yellow Flash, he wastes no time and directly hits Momoshiki with a Odama Rasengan.

Konohamaru, starts to make another Rasenshuriken. Boruto, a hot blooded shinobi like Naruto, jumps in. He starts spamming Rasengan and a few of them actually hit Momoshiki, but those Rasengan has no effect on Momoshiki. Momoshiki now matching Minato’s speed, is giving Minato himself a hard time.

Boruto, who is jumping in the battle gets some serious hits and is injured. Minato uses some excellent strategy and catches Momoshiki and then Konohamaru, hits him with Rasenshuriken.

Momoshiki, who is gravely injured tries to run, but Boruto has a Rasengan ready. Minato and Konohamaru provides him chakre to make a big Rasengan and then some shurikens come and penetrate on Momoshiki’s leg, making him unable to run.

Itachi smiles from the shadows as Boruto kills Momoshiki with that Rasengan.

Now, the incident is over and all. Team 7 does some missions before the time skip, in which they train to become super-powerful.
